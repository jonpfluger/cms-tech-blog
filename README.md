# CMS Tech Blog

## Description

This application lets a user create an account, read posts about tech, and write their own posts.

Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies.
